# DAS-I-Discipline
In this repository, you will find the final assignment done for the Data and Algorithms Structures discipline from the Bachelor's Degree in Universidade de Ã‰vora.

The assignment consisted of the creation of o program written in C, with optimized persistent memory, that would calculate the distance between points in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm

Unfortunately, couldn't find the report or the briefing document.
